# Randomized Algorithms - Assignment #1

This repository contains the Python implementation of Assignment #1 for the **Randomized Algorithms (RA-MIRI)** course. The code simulates a Galton board to study the distribution of ball landings, comparing empirical results with theoretical binomial and normal distributions.

## Files

- `galton_board_simulation.py` â€“ main Python script implementing all experiments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
